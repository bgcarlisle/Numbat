Numbat Meta-Analysis Extraction Manager

## Overview

Numbat is free software first developed by PhD student Benjamin Carlisle [^1] in 2014 for use by the STREAM research group[^2] in the Biomedical Ethics Unit at McGill University to facilitate meta-analytic work for the *Animals, Humans and the Continuity of Evidence* grant as well as the *Signals, Safety and Success* grant. This work was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 119574), and it is released as free and open-source under the GNU GPL v 2.

It is named after the numbat, because numbats feed on termites by extracting them from their hiding places with very long and flexible tongues.
