## Overview

Numbat is free software first developed by PhD student Benjamin Carlisle in 2014 for use by the STREAM research group[^1] in the Biomedical Ethics Unit at McGill University to facilitate meta-analytic work for the *Animals, Humans and the Continuity of Evidence* grant as well as the *Signals, Safety and Success* grant. This work was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 119574), and it is released as free and open-source under the GNU GPL v 2.

It is named after the numbat, because numbats feed on termites by extracting them from their hiding places with very long and flexible tongues.

### What Numbat does

Numbat is a piece of software designed for managing the extraction of large volumes of data from primary sources among multiple users, and then reconciling the differences between them.

* Manage large databases of references
* Different levels of extraction (e.g. title-and-abstract vs full extraction)
* Multiple extraction forms / codebooks
* Multiple users, with an assignment manager
* Can generate reference networks among the publications in the database

### What Numbat doesn't do

* Statistical analysis
* Automatic semantic analysis (you have to read the papers yourself)
* Magic

You may be able to install Numbat on setups different from what is described below, but the following is what it was designed for.
