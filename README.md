# Numbat Systematic Review Manager

## Overview

The source code for Numbat is available on
[Github](https://github.com/bgcarlisle/Numbat "Numbat Github").

Numbat is free software first developed by Benjamin Carlisle in 2014
for use by the STREAM research group[^1] in the Biomedical Ethics Unit
at McGill University to facilitate systematic review work for the
*Animals, Humans and the Continuity of Evidence* grant as well as the
*Signals, Safety and Success* grant. This work was funded by the
Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 119574), and it is
released as free and open-source under the GNU AGPL v 3.

It is named after the numbat, because numbats feed on termites by
extracting them from their hiding places with very long and flexible
tongues.

## Purpose and limitations

### What Numbat does

Numbat is a piece of software designed for managing the extraction of
large volumes of data from primary sources among multiple users, and
then reconciling the differences between them. It is designed for use
in systematic review projects in an academic context.

The following are the intended uses of Numbat.

* Manage large databases of references ("large" here means: in the
  hundreds to thousands range; there's no built-in limit on Numbat,
  but your server may time out or something if you tell it to run a
  PHP script that takes too long)
* Different levels of extraction (e.g. title-and-abstract vs full
  extraction)
* Multiple extraction forms / codebooks
* Double, triple or n extractors, with an assignment manager
* Generate reference networks among the publications in the database

### What Numbat doesn't do

* Statistical analysis of results
* Calculating inter-rater reliability estimates (but it will export
  extractions in a format that the `irr` *R* package expects!)
* Semantic analysis of papers to extract (you have to read the papers
  yourself)
* Magic

### Values for the Numbat project

* No user lock-in as a philosophy for data in Numbatâ€”data entered in
  Numbat should be easily imported and exported, so that users are
  never trapped
* Open formats
* Usability
* Expandability / modularity of software
* Ownership of one's own data
* Low barriers to entry
* Ease of back-up

### Why not just use a Google Form?

* Google has a bad record for keeping private data private
* No good, built-in way to reconcile multiple extractions
* Built-in blinding from other extractors' work to minimise validity
  threats to your systematic review work
* Built-in assignment manager
* Google Forms do not accommodate certain data structures, like table
  data and citation networks

## Installation requirements

You may be able to install Numbat on setups different from what is
described below, but the following is what it was designed for.

* Apache
* PHP
* MySQL

Copy the entire file to your web server, and navigate to the Numbat
directory with your browser. You will need to know your MySQL server,
username and password to complete the installation.

## What's new in 2.13

* Button to automate copying of all rows in table from all users to
  final during reconciliation
* New random references selector options for assignments
* Fix bug with table data entry
* Upload new references into an already-existing reference set
* Fixed bug where order of columns in data export sometimes doesn't
  match the order they appear in the extraction form
* Fixed bug where date selector would save empty fields as
  "0000-00-00" instead of NULL
* Removed unnecessary rows showing references without complete
  extractions from final table
* Implemented import/export of conditional display logic in extraction
  forms
* Implemented a new "tags" element for extractions and sub-extractions
* Removed Google Font, replaced with [Atkinson
  Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)
* Fixed bug where deleting elements would fail to also delete their
  child conditional display triggers, resulting in unexpected
  behaviour
* Added IRR (inter-rater reliability, e.g. Cohen's kappa) export for
  open text, single select and multi select elements to allow users to
  export all extractions of a single element in a format that would be
  expected by many of the functions in the `irr` *R* package
* Added drop-down selector for sorting extractions to be done on the
  "Do extractions" page by reference, form and assignment date
  (previously, extractions were sorted by assignment date only)
* Added `whenassigned` and `status` columns to assignment export

To migrate from an earlier version of Numbat, run `db-migrations.php`
while logged in as an administrator.

If you use my software to complete a systematic review and you found
it useful, I would take it as a kindness if you cited it.
