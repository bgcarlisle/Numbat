# References and reference sets

A reference is a row in a table 

Reference set tables are named `referenceset_1`, `referenceset_2`,
etc. in the database back-end, with Numbat automatically assigning a
reference set ID as an incrementing integer value. This cannot be
changed after it is assigned. Columns in a reference set are defined
by the user when it is uploaded.
