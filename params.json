This work was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 119574), and it is released as free and open-source under the GNU GPL v 2.\r\n\r\nIt is named after the numbat, because numbats feed on termites by extracting them from their hiding places with very long and flexible tongues.\r\n\r\n[^1]: <http://www.translationalethics.com/>\r\n\r\n## Purpose and limitations\r\n\r\n### What Numbat does\r\n\r\nNumbat is a piece of software designed for managing the extraction of large volumes of data from primary sources among multiple users, and then reconciling the differences between them.\r\n\r\n* Manage large databases of references\r\n* Different levels of extraction (e.g. title-and-abstract vs full extraction)\r\n* Multiple extraction forms / codebooks\r\n* Multiple users, with an assignment manager\r\n* Can generate reference networks among the publications in the database\r\n\r\n### What Numbat doesn't do\r\n\r\n* Statistical analysis of results\r\n* Calculating Kohen's kappa\r\n* Semantic analysis of papers to extract (you have to read the papers yourself)\r\n* Magic\r\n\r\n### Why not just use a Google Form?\r\n\r\n* Google has a bad record for keeping private data private\r\n* No good, built-in way to reconcile multiple extractions\r\n* Built-in blinding from other extractors' work to minimise validity threats to your meta-analytic work\r\n* Built-in assignment manager\r\n* Google Forms do not accommodate certain data structures, like table data and reference networks\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation requirements\r\n\r\nYou may be able to install Numbat on setups different from what is described below, but the following is what it was designed for.\r\n\r\n* Apache 2.2.22-14\r\n* PHP 5.3.27\r\n* MySQL 5\r\n\r\nCopy the entire file to your web server, and navigate to the Numbat directory with your browser. You will need to know your MySQL server, username and password to complete the installation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact info\r\n\r\nI cannot guarantee that I will be able to help you with your problems. Depending on the nature and scope of your problems, I may not even try. That said, if you have found bugs, or if you have ideas for future directions for the software, here are some reasonably reliable ways to contact me.\r\n\r\n* Email: <benjamin.carlisle@mcgill.ca>\r\n* Twitter: @numbatmanager\r\n* Bitmessage: BM-2DBF2CD9Dq25NnESpf4gZ69r5UqoCAbVZV\r\n* Post: Room 303, 3647 rue Peel, Montréal QC H1M 2N9","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
